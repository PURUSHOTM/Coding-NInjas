/*
Shortest Subsequence
Send Feedback
Gary has two string S and V. Now, Gary wants to know the length shortest subsequence in S, which is not a subsequence in V.
Note: The input data will be such that there will always be a solution.
Input Format :
The first line of input contains a string, that denotes the value of S. The following line contains a string, that denotes the value of V.
Output Format :
Length of shortest subsequence in S such that it is not a subsequence in V
Constraints:
1 <= |S| <= 1000 (|x| implies the length of the string x)
1 <= |V| <= 1000
Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1:
babab
babba
Sample Output 1:
3
Explanation:
"aab" is the shortest subsequence which is present in S and absent in V.
